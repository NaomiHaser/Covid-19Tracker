### Things to keep in mind (review from the ReactJS tutorial):
1. Plan out what features your web app need to have and structure the component folder well. Each component needs to have its .jxs and module.css files. .jxs allows us to write HTML in react, and the module css just makes sure that there’s no mix up between classes.
### Things to import:
1. API: import axios to make API request. Remmeber to use asysn functions
2. install @material-ui/core for faster web design (we use Card, )
3. install chart.js to visualize charts
### When we add mew changes to the code
1. Make another branch, test it out, and merge it with the master. Don’t make changes directly on master!
2. Work on your seperate branches this weekend, and we will merge them next week.
